Snap Ninja was built with the importance of peer collaboration in a variety of environments in mind. For students at Turing and coding schools like it, helping and being helped by your peers is one of the cornerstones of any person's success. 

Other levels of education can also benefit from a tool like Snap Ninja that tries to help build collective success. Finally, we believe that Snap Ninja could be used in any workplace setting that might benefit from a system designed to prove and demonstrate that people appreciate each other's efforts.
